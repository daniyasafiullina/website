            <strong>Yoga</strong> <i>noun</i> - a set of physical and mental
            exercises, originally from India, intended to give control over the
            body and mind
          </p>

          <h2>Benefits of Practicing Yoga</h2>
          <p>
            The benefits of yoga are as diverse as the practice itself. Regular
            engagement in yoga can lead to improved physical health, enhanced
            mental clarity, and a deep sense of inner calm. From increased
            flexibility, strength, and balance to stress reduction, emotional
            stability, and better posture, the advantages of yoga are both
            tangible and transformative.

            <p>
              You can't go a mile without running into a yoga studio. It seems
              like the trendy new thing to buy a pastel yoga mat and lurid pink
              yoga pants and go into a Sun Salutation. But we are not talking
              about yoga today because it's a good excuse to wear yoga pants.
              This week on WellCast, we're going to show you why even just a few
              minutes of yoga a week will make you more mentally alert, happier,
              and healthier. You ready? </p><p>There are plenty of studies that
              demonstrate yoga's potential for health. For example, Oxford
              University found that people who practice yoga even once a week
              were less stressed out, have lower blood pressure, and slept
              better at night. And yoga is not just good for your mental health.
              According to the National Institute of Health, it's proven to help
              with musculoskeletal issues, especially lower back pain. It can
              even help relieve asthma. So why don't more people try yoga?</p><p> Some
              are afraid it'll be too difficult. Hey, you see enough people bent
              into pretzels and you start to believe that you'll never be
              flexible enough. But what you might not know is yoga isn't a
              one-size-fits-all proposition. There are tons of different types
              of yoga, all with names that are kind of difficult to remember.
              There's hatha, Bikram, vinyasa, the list goes on. And while some
              types do encourage a hard workout where you bend and flex in
              insane positions and sweat bullets, yoga can more simply be just
              used as a meditative tool, and you get the same mental health
              benefits. Here's a word you probably haven't heard before:
              pranayama. It means focus on deep breathing and gentle stretching.
              It's also what people in that Oxford University study tested and
              found to be so intricately connected to happiness. Anyone, at any
              skill level, can try pranayama. So that is what we're going to
              practice today on WellCast. </p><p> Ok, stand comfortably, evenly on your
              two feet. You shouldn't be on your heels or on your toes. Center
              yourself and then notice your breath. Breathe deeply. Try to stay
              away from shallow chest breathing. Take a few minutes just to
              focus on your breath. Now it's time to link your breath and
              movement, gentle stretching style. When you breathe in, raise your
              arms, and when you breathe out, lower your arms. Simple as that.
              Keep your shoulders down and relax your hands. If you want, you
              can spend 20 minutes doing this. The simple stuff is good stuff,
              or you can look up something a little bit more involved. Try
              googling Sun Salutation or beginners yoga sequence. Spend a little
              time taking stock of how you feel. What do you think of yoga now
              that you've tried it for the first time?
